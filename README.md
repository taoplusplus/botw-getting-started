# Getting Started

## Step 1: Finish Casual Play

Are you done exploring Breath of the Wild yet? We generally recommend players finish their casual experience before looking into speedrunning. If you're looking for a missing shrine, wondering what quests there are to do, or hunting for koroks and aren't yet worried about speed, Zelda Dungeon's walkthrough is a good place to go: https://www.zeldadungeon.net/breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough/


## Step 2: Watch Runs

Watch at least one run to get a feeling for what runs are like and which category you would enjoy most. Here are the current world records for some popular categories.

Any% in 23:53 by Player5 https://youtu.be/MJzbUcXcEkw  
All Dungeons in 1:28:59 by Zdi https://youtu.be/6ejOca1qHL8  
Master Sword Restricted in 1:16:16 by Player5 https://youtu.be/q13JFCnwW94

Also look for community members who stream their attempts by looking in #streams or searching for Breath of the Wild speedruns on Twitch: http://bombch.us/DWNE


## Step 3: Learn the Movement Glitches

Windbombs and Bow Lift Smuggle Slide (BLSS) are the primary movement techniques in every category. To get started learning windbombs, check out Vivoxe's tutorials at http://bombch.us/DWK5. To get started with BLSS, check out Kleric's tutorial at https://youtu.be/F1gUS5kVEXA.

See *Highlighted Resources* in the #resources channel for more in-depth guides. And information that's important to each category is in the pins of their respective channels.

We also have a #bug-limit categories that restrict the types of glitches runners can use.


## Step 4: Learn the Great Plateau

Every category starts on the Great Plateau. Learning how to quickly complete the first four shrines and get the paraglider is a great first goal. We usually recommend new runners aim for a Great Plateau time around 20 minutes before moving on. Here are two tutorials to get started:
* How to Speedrun Breath of the Wildâ€™s Great Plateau (Beginner Tutorial) https://youtu.be/r5utB87iQ_Y
* 2022 BOTW Any% Tutorial Series http://bombch.us/DWNF

Will there ever be a way to skip the Great Plateau? Probably not: https://youtu.be/NvnKghPudyU

## Step 5: Ask Questions

A lot of community members are happy to answer questions about anything, no matter how small. You can post questions or gameplay in the appropriate category channel (like #great-plateau or #any-percent). If you don't know where a question should go, feel free to use #general-help.

One of the best ways to get advice on your play is to share a game recording. You can capture 30 seconds of gameplay on the Switch and share it via a file download or a Twitter account: http://bombch.us/DWKx. If you are uploading a video, https://8mb.video/ can help get around Discord's 8 mb limit.
